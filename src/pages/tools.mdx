# Tools, the narrated version

## Devices

- 2018 12.9” iPad Pro + second-gen Pencil (+ a Smart Keyboard Folio + a Brydge keyboard). I’ve been extremely passionate about iPad since the original, but this iteration is an enormous leap forward. I take my iPad with me practically everywhere.
  - As my iPhones have gotten larger (iPhone 7, X, now XS Max), I started doing more work from them because it was less painful, but it slowed me down. iPad is far superior for work.
- Apple Watch (Series 4). More of a life tool than a creative tool, but improving my fitness + sleep helps me be more creative.
- 2018 MacBook Pro 13” with Touch Bar. I want to get rid of Macss in my workflow for a full-iPad life, but the developer tools just aren’t available on iPad yet. I find the windows, notifications, customization, file system, apps, etc a distracting nightmare to use & it wastes my time. I want to write Shortcuts, not script a filesystem I wish I didn’t have to deal with. But the majority of my published creative output (websites, designs, code) are made through my Mac.
- Sometimes, an external 21” display at my desk. While I’m coding, connected to my MacBook. Just as often connected to my iPad—even larger screen for reading, watching stuff. (Idea 100% [via Federico Viticci](https://www.macstories.net/ipad-diaries/ipad-diaries-the-many-setups-of-the-2018-ipad-pro/).) Really disappointing how few apps support external displays, & iOS is super limiting here.
- In the past, used a Wacom Intuos, but my iPad has subsumed all that.

## Apps

- GoodNotes, for handwriting. At school, during calls, when I’m having ideas I want to get out quickly, to make wireframes/mockups of interfaces I’m designing
- Figma on my Mac, for designing assets. Can’t wait to use this on iPad
- VSCode for Mac, where I spend many hours/week coding. Want this on my iPad too, if you sense a theme here :) This is actually one of my primary creative tools, because I build websites, design systems frameworks, apps, etc. It’s focused on being a great code editor, which it is, not a creative tool, but a huge chunk of my creative output goes through code in VSCode.
- Drafts on iOS, as a scratchpad when I want to write text down super quickly
- iA Writer (mostly iPad, occasionally iPhone/Mac). For writing anything long + all school-related writing. Markdown is huge for me—it’s my mental framework of text, keeping my words in plain text + having separate “render targets”/templates/stylesheets. iA is one of a few companies that really think about thinking + build a tool for that, but most of my work isn’t writing like that.
- Things, for keeping track of tasks (all devices)
- Shortcuts on iOS. I have hundreds & use them constantly for image processing, file management, Apple Music, Bear scripting
- Apple Music. Use it for hours a day while I’m working, walking, etc
- Day One. I haven’t used it much in 2019, but kept a fairly regular journal from 2012 onwards. Used to be a significant creative tool
